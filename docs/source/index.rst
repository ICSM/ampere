Welcome to AMPERE's documentation!
==================================

**AMPERE** is a package for inference.
Aimed at astronomers, it aims to make it possible to model complex datasets,
even when your model is unable to explain all the features of the data.
It aims to make it easy to use a range of techniques that are, perhaps,
overlooked in astronomy, enabling the community to attack more complex problems.
In particular, we want to enable inference even with very slow models.
